If you want to use Vite to build the React Okta App, you maybe face some incompatible issues. I will share some of my research in this post.

### Issue 1: Uncaught TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null

As the Okta's staff said, It's a known issue with the ESM bundle of okta-auth-js.

So, we should add the below into the `vite.config.ts`

```js
resolve: {
  alias: [
    {
      find: '@okta/okta-auth-js',
      replacement: require.resolve(
        '@okta/okta-auth-js/dist/okta-auth-js.umd.js'
      ),
    },
  ],
},
```

### Issue2: Security.tsx:99 Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined

Solution: Add the below code to the `vite.config.ts`

```js
define: {
  'process.env': process.env
}
```

You can find the final version code on [okta-demo](https://github.com/sinchang-codespaces/okta-demo).
