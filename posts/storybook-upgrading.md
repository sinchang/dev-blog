I recently upgraded the Storybook from v6.1.11 to v6.4.19 in my company's project, but the process is not smooth. I met the two issues on my upgrading.

### Issue1: Missing class properties transform

Solution: add the below code to the ./storybook/main.js.

```js
module.exports = {
  babel: async (options) => ({
    ...options,
    plugins: [["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties", { loose: true }]],
  }),
};
```

### Issue2: iframe.html no longer built with --preview-url

My storybook website runs in a subpath domain so should add `--preview-url` on the build command, but sadly find iframe.html no longer generated after upgrading.

The solved way is adding the option `--force-build-preview` to the build command.
